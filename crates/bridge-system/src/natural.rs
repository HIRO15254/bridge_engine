//! Natural inference: a generic meaning for any call, used when the system has no entry.
//!
//! The rules are a small ordered table over a [`CallContext`] (role, call kind, level, …) and
//! produce constraints from [`NaturalParams`]. [`classify`] is system-independent and testable
//! on its own. Accuracy is measured three ways (hold-out against compiled systems, reproduction
//! rate, corpus satisfaction); see `docs/design/06-system.md`.
